You slowly open your eyes as you regain consciousness. You're sitting in front of your laptop, inside your bedroom. Looks like you have fallen asleep during work. As you compose yourself from dizziness, you notice something isn't right.

But you don't look like me at all.

This is Memento Space. It is a domain deep inside your subconsciousness, constructed with the most significant components your memory. As for why you are here......Do you know what is a flashback?

When the body faces existential crisis, the brain desperately searches the memories for ways to save itself, making people experience memories from the past. On the other hand, overfatigue put you in a deep coma. Your dwindling mind tangled with the memories, bringing you to this space in your dream.

That is the unfortunate truth. There are so many things I want to talk with you, but it seems that this is not the time for it yet. Your body in the real world is dying now as we speak. You have to wake up......before there is no return.
How can I wake up?

Your hope of coming back to life lies in the Memento Space. In order to wake up, you need to collect the 3 relics: your id card, the alarm clock, and the token.

Your id card protects your self cognition, the alarm clock lets your consciousness emerge from the sea of subconsciousness. I do not know what the token is for, or what form it takes: I think that is information known to you alone.

There are no people in the main hall, the screens are showing posters of old movies. You explored the rooms one by one, until you finally found a girl sleeping in an empty theater.
